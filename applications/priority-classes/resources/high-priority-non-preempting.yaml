description: |
   This priority class is used for jobs that need to be prioritized 
   above other workloads, but do not need to discard existing work 
   by preempting running pods.
   
   Pods with preemptionPolicy: Never will be placed in the scheduling 
   queue ahead of lower-priority pods, but they cannot preempt other pods. 
   
   A non-preempting pod waiting to be scheduled will stay in the scheduling 
   queue, until sufficient resources are free, and it can be scheduled. 
   Non-preempting pods, like other pods, are subject to scheduler back-off. 
   This means that if the scheduler tries these pods and they cannot be 
   scheduled, they will be retried with lower frequency, allowing other 
   pods with lower priority to be scheduled before them.

   Non-preempting pods may still be preempted by other, high-priority pods.

   The high priority job with preemptionPolicy: Never will be 
   scheduled ahead of other queued pods, as soon as sufficient 
   cluster resources "naturally" become free.

   This priority class will not cause other pods to be preempted.
