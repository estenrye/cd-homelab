preemptionPolicy: PreemptLowerPriority
description: |
  This priority class is used for jobs that need to be prioritized 
  above other workloads, and may need to discard existing work 
  by preempting running pods.
  
  Pods with preemptionPolicy: PreemptLowerPriority will be placed in the scheduling 
  queue ahead of lower-priority pods, and they can preempt other pods. 
  
  A preempting pod waiting to be scheduled will stay in the scheduling 
  queue, until sufficient resources are free, and it can be scheduled. 
  Preempting pods, like other pods, are subject to scheduler back-off. 
  This means that if the scheduler tries these pods and they cannot be 
  scheduled, they will be retried with lower frequency, allowing other 
  pods with lower priority to be scheduled before them.

  Preempting pods may still be preempted by other, high-priority pods.
